# bibliography

Inspired by Makino Takaki's [Generate BiBTeX entry from plain text](http://www.snowelm.com/~t/doc/tips/makebib.en.html) (original perl file [here](http://www.snowelm.com/~t/doc/tips/makebib.perl)).

I don't know any perl, so I decided to try to implement this in Python.

Heavily work-in-progress, definitely not complete.
